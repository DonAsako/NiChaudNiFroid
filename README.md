## Description

[itch.io page](https://asakosan.itch.io/ni-chaud-ni-froid-the-game)

The objective of the game is straightforward: similar to the dinosaur game, but with the added rule of maintaining a temperature range between -5째C and 5째C. Our temperature increases by 1째C upon touching fire and decreases by 1째C upon touching ice.
